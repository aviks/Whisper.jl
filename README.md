## Whisper

[![Build Status](https://github.com/aviks/Whisper.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/aviks/Whisper.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)


Whisper.jl is a Julia package for automatic speech recognition, based on [OpenAI's Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) model. This package wraps the [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) code, which is a C/C++ implementation of the model. It uses the model weights which were published by OpenAI.
